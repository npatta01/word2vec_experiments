Maybe something different with this type of VPN?</p>\n\n<p>Question 2: I also have a Linksys WRT54GS router which I am currently using as a gateway to extend my WIFI range in the office. Can I use it as a router to create a 10.10.1.x subnet, so as to connect with it to the VPN instead? I have tried to switch its Advanced Routing mode to Router (from Gateway), and tried to configure Dynamic routing, as well as static routing, but in both cases it does not work; My PC gets the 10.10.1.x IP address, and I can ping the 10.10.1.1 (the Linksys router's LAN IP address), and even ping 192.168.1.142 (the Linksys router's WAN IP address). But I cannot ping my Thompson router's IP (192.168.1.254). Furthermore, from a PC in the 192.168.1.x network I cannot ping the Linksys router's WAN IP address (192.168.1.142). </p>\n\n<p>Do you have any ideas as to what the problem might be in this case? I have not defined any routes on the Thompson router, and no, I cannot change its internal DHCP network to use the 10.10.1.x range. It is locked I think from my ISP.</p>\n", "id": 698287, "answers": "", "title": "How to create a subnet at home with Linksys router"}, {"strength": 0.99415444035195832, "question": "<p>Using VMware players on Windows 7 with a Ubuntu 10.04 guest.

What I am trying to do is to configure the first guest to be a router and configure the second guest to use the first guest as it's gateway.  So what I want is a virtual LAN where the guests get internet access through the single guest that is bridged to the host.</p>\n\n<p>In this configuration, the bridged guest does have internet access until I add the configuration for the second interface to the /etc/network/interfaces file.  Once I add that interface and do /etc/init.d/networking restart the bridged guest can no longer ping any external hosts.</p>\n\n<p>Content of interfaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nauto eth1\niface eth1 inet dhcp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output of route -n</p>\n\n<pre><code>Kernel IP routing table\nDestination    Gateway          Genmask       Iface\n192.168.1.0    0.0.0.0          255.25.255.0  eth0\n10.0.0.0       0.0.0.0          255.0.0.0     eth1\n0.0.0.0        192.168.1.1      0.0.0.0       eth0\n</code></pre>\n", "id": 271510, "answers": "", "title": "Setup a VM router in vmware workstation"}, {"strength": 0.99224529324826494, "question": "<p>I would like to achieve VPN access to my home router running on DD-WRT, so everything will go through VPN and I will access hosts on my home network.

I have a personal server, which is a DMZ host in my home network. I can access the server via the public IP of the router, since DMZ is set. But it only works when I access from an external network, e.g. when I'm at work or using my phone via 3G. Within the home network, it seems the traffic isn't forwarded to the DMZ. It was not a problem with the old router, which is much cheaper than the Linksys E4200V2.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn't find an option to fix the problem in the router's admin page. The closest was \"Filter Internet NAT Redirection for IPv4 Internet Only\" in the Security > Firewall section but it didn't work.</p>\n\n<p>There are two ways to work around it I can think of.</p>\n\n<p>The first is running my own name server, which resolves the domain name of the public IP of the router to the internal IP of the DMZ host.

I wanted to access the server over the Internet,  so I set up a DyDNS domain (example.no-ip.org) which points to the routers WAN ip and set up a virtual server rule in the router which forwards all requests on port 8888 to 192.168.0.10:5900. When I put example.no-ip.org::8888 in tightvnc viewer (using a separate Internet connection at a friends house) I can't connect to the server. I can connect to the Apache Web server on the server running at Port 80 over the Internet (at example. no-ip.org) but not the vnc server running at Port 5900. It means the DyDNS service is pointing to the correct ip. The Web server also has a similar virtual server rule in the router pointing all traffic at Port 80 on the router to 192.168.0.10:80.

If so, does anyone have the relevant iptables rules they could give me?</p>\n", "id": 492128, "answers": "", "title": "Squid - transparent proxy with NICs on same subnet?"}, {"strength": 0.98891274743212076, "question": "<p>I am using a router (openwrt) as server.</p>\n\n<p>route -n (before VPN):</p>\n\n<pre><code>Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         192.168.1.254   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.1.2     127.0.0.1       255.255.255.255 UGH   303    0        0 lo\n192.168.1.134   127.0.0.1       255.255.255.255 UGH   303    0        0 lo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>route -n (after VPN):</p>\n\n<pre><code> Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\n0.0.0.0         10.10.10.1      0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 tap0\n10.10.10.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 tap0\n46...........   192.168.1.254   255.255.255.255 UGH   0      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     9      0        0 wlan0\n192.168.1.2     127.0.0.1       255.255.255.255 UGH   302    0        0 lo\n192.168.1.134   127.0.0.1       255.255.255.255 UGH   302    0        0 lo\n192.168.1.135   127.0.0.1       255.255.255.255 UGH   302    0        0 lo\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My router is at 192.168.1.1.</p>\n\n<p>I can connect to VPN but I have no internet access.The field</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Use only for resources on this connection</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is not checked.\nIf I check it,then I can have internet access but as I can see traceroute is the same before and after VPN.Also,the IP doesn't change.</p>\n\n<p>/etc/config/openvpn</p>\n\n<pre><code>config 'openvpn' 'lan'\n   option 'enable' '1'\n   option 'port' '1194'\n   option 'proto' 'udp'\n   option 'dev' 'tap0'\n   option 'ca' '/etc/openvpn/ca.crt'\n   option 'cert' '/etc/openvpn/server.crt'\n   option 'key' '/etc/openvpn/server.key'\n   option 'dh' '/etc/openvpn/dh1024.pem'\n   option 'ifconfig_pool_persist' '/tmp/ipp.txt'\n   option 'keepalive' '10 120'\n   option 'comp_lzo' '1'\n   option 'persist_key' '1'\n   list 'push' 'dhcp-option DNS 192.168.1.1'\n   option 'server_bridge' '10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 10.10.10.10'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>/etc/config/firewall</p>\n\n<pre><code>config  'rule'\n    option 'target' 'ACCEPT'\n    option 'dest_port' '1194'\n    option 'src' 'wan'\n    option 'proto' 'tcpudp'\n    option 'family' 'ipv4'\n</code></pre>\n", "id": 703042, "answers": "", "title": "openvpn no access - No route to host"}, {"strength": 0.98891080163632328, "question": "<p>I have a home network with two routers connected through LAN.

No changes to your computer will be saved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are 2 interesting things about that message, the first one is that after I rebooted to Linux, the partitions Windows has created were still there, therefore changes to my computer apparently were saved.

My suspicion is that the installer did not see - from whatever reason - my already existing partition on <strong>Drive 0</strong> and attempted to create a new one. However, since a partition already existed on <strong>Drive 2</strong> and I think the installer later looks for the EFI partition using just the index number on the drive, it found a different partition which was - in this case - formatted as NTFS, hence giving me the error message.</p>\n\n<p>I tried one other things, and that was installing on a GPT drive with no partitions at all. What surprised me is that the installation failed too, with the following message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Windows could not prepare your computer to boot into the next stage of the installation. To install Windows, please restart the installation.
